# Bus Management System

This is a simple bus management program made using **Python**. Via this program, one can check availability of buses and book the bus as per the need.  
It uses the **os** module and uses the concepts of functions, file handling and loops to implement the functionality. Files are used to check availability of buses and loops are used for the various decisions. The. availability of buses is determined by the user-given inputs of departure destination, arrival destination and time. Booking is done via a user-defined function *book* which requires important information such as name, phone number and gender and can print the ticket and confirm the booking.
